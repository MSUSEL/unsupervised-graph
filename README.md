# unsupervised-graph
A repository to house unsupervised graph work

This repository holds source code that is used to (1) generate graphs from binary files (2) generate synthetic graphs for comparison (3) create embeddings from input graphs (4) use embedding representation as input to unsupervised tasks such as clustering and anomaly detectio.n
